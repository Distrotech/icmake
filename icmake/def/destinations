/*
    The locations of the binaries, the man pages and the documentation
    ==================================================================
 
    Note: when changing the location to another location, make sure the
    icmake-path definitions in the top lines of all executable icmake 
    scripts (e.g., the `./unix' script) are changed accordingly.
 
    `unix doc2man' will install manpages in the CATDIR directory
    `unix install' will install the binaries in the BINDIR directory

    Note that BINDIR is also used in the first line of the unix-script.
 
    If you don't use /usr/bin, make sure you adapt the first line
    in the 'unix' script *AND* the BINDIR define 
 
    The settings in this file are according to the Debian File Standard

    Alternate definitions may be kept in this file, on lines starting 
    with  //
