icmake (6.30)
    
    Debian patches up to 6.22-7 processed; more in general: the sources now
    compile free of warnings

    chdir("") now returns initial working directory

    Execution error on the powerpc repaired. Caused by strcmp() sometimes
    returning a non-zero value having its lowest 16 bits equal to zero. Since 
    icmake internally uses 16-bits int values, this results in a zero value
    following an int to int16 assignment. See, e.g.,  exec/string/compare.c

    During the process of repairing the above error, Icm-exec was completely
    rewritten. 

    Lintian warning about an error in the icmake.1 manual page repaired
    Lindian warning about the inappropriate executable mode of 
    examples/defines.im repaired.

    Newer versions of icmake programs operate fine on existing (older) binary
    scripts as long as icmake's major version isn't upgraded. Newer versions
    of binary icmake files remain to be inexecutable with older icmake
    versions. 
    
    PRE-ANNOUNCING VERSION 7.00:

    A major upgrade (to version 7.00) will be released soon. As a prelude: it
    will define new built-in functions: getenv() and substr() will be
    completely new, and strstr() will be replaced by the new function
    strfind(). Existing scripts defining getenv(), substr() and/or strfind()
    should rename these functions to, e.g., my_getenv() (and comparable) or
    (possibly) remove these definitions and use the new built-in functions.

    The distiction between distribution version and program version (see
    below) is removed. All programs will have the same version as the
    distribution. 

    ----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:   The version referred to here is the version of the distribution,
        not of the icmake programs.

6.22    Compiler warnings and the use of gets() removed from the sources
        All programs now use the same version, which is defined in 
        version.c, which is defined in the rss.
        Standard manpage (icmake.1) included in the distribution.
    
6.21    Elf binaries for unix

6.20    Unix-icmake accepts the -t flag, to specify a temporary binary-
        icmake file. Allowing in unix-environments the riddance of the
        permanent bim-file. The temporary binary makefile will --in this
        case-- get the process-id for its extension.

6.18 - 6.19: Not distributed.

6.17b   DOS-distribution only: Dependencies on icce.h and sicce.lib
    removed from the distribution. Programs are *not* affected by
    this distribution.
    
6.17    Comment accepted in #define directives,
        Trailing info on #include lines ignored,
    Minor changes to documentation files.

6.17    This is as far as our memory reaches: the log of changes before
        this distribution are lost to future generations...
        This release never made sunsite or tsx-11. Only ftp.icce.rug.nl
    got it, and two sub-releases beyond.
