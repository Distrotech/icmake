icmake (7.00)

  * Defines (#define) may use other #defined variables to determine their
    value. 

    icmake's sources may use hexadecimal constants (0xdead)

    global and local variables may be immediately initialized by constants
    and/or available functions. Variables cannot be used for the
    initialization. 

    execute() function repaired: it never succeeded due to invalid return
    value

    initial source may or may not have .im extension, as suggested in the 
    general usage info provided by icmake itself. If the specified initial
    source does not exist, an .im extension is attempted.

    The IM environment variable may contain several, `:'-delimited paths

    chdir("") now returns initial working directory

    getenv() implemented: returns list: [0]: ok (or not), [1]: value of the
    environment variable

    strlen/strupr/strlwr now defined as rss-functions, no longer as macros

    strstr renamed to strfind. 

    substr() added, returning a substring from an existing string.

    (f)printf() now have int-return values (instead of undefined)

    icmake manual page rewritten

    icmbuild script for general program maintenance added
    icmbuild manual page added

    the `unix' script will regenerate the parser and the lexical scanner if
    their specification files have changed.

    Debian patches up to 6.22-7 processed; more in general: the sources now
    compile completely free of warnings

    The distinction between program and version distribution has been
    discontinued. Now there's only a distribution version, shown by all
    icmake-programs.

NOTE:   The version referred to here is the version of the distribution,
        not of the icmake programs.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

6.22    Compiler warnings and the use of gets() removed from the sources
        All programs now use the same version, which is defined in 
        version.c, which is defined in the rss.
        Standard manpage (icmake.1) included in the distribution.
    
6.21    Elf binaries for unix

6.20    Unix-icmake accepts the -t flag, to specify a temporary binary-
        icmake file. Allowing in unix-environments the riddance of the
        permanent bim-file. The temporary binary makefile will --in this
        case-- get the process-id for its extension.

6.18 - 6.19: Not distributed.

6.17b   DOS-distribution only: Dependencies on icce.h and sicce.lib
    removed from the distribution. Programs are *not* affected by
    this distribution.
    
6.17    Comment accepted in #define directives,
        Trailing info on #include lines ignored,
    Minor changes to documentation files.

6.17    This is as far as our memory reaches: the log of changes before
        this distribution are lost to future generations...
        This release never made sunsite or tsx-11. Only ftp.icce.rug.nl
    got it, and two sub-releases beyond.
