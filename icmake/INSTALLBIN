INSTALLING ICMAKE BINARIES
==========================

        The icmake binaries come as a compressed archive: E.g.,
"icmake-6.15.bin.tgz". This archive unpacks to several directories and files.

Please note that the archive unpacks to directories icmake/xxx below the 
current directory. So, if you unpack icmake-6.17.bin.tgz (or later versions) 
in the directory /usr/local/src/icmake, a directory 
/usr/local/src/icmake/icmake is created, and other subdirectories below 
/usr/local/src/icmake/icmake.

        To unpack the archive, create an appropriate directory (e.g.,
"/usr/local/src/icmake" and change-dir to that directory. Use an appropriate 
archiver to unpack. The archive can be unpacked as follows:

        "gzip -c -d icmake-6.17.bin.tgz | tar xvf -".

If you have GNU tar version 1.11.2 or higher, you can use

        "tar xvzf icmake-6.17.bin.tgz".
	
For Linux-unix platforms, the icmake-executables are found in the subdirectory
binlinux. For Ms-DOS platforms, the icmake-executables are found in the
subdirectory bindos. Depending on what platform you use, install either, both,
or none of these executables in your preferred locations. You have to
to that yourself, using, e.g., cp. For example, the command:

                cp binlinux/* /usr/local/bin
		
will copy the linux binaries in /usr/local/bin. Normally you must be root to
accomplish this.
