.PP 
.SH "NAME"
icmconf \- Configuration file for the \fBicmbuild\fP(1) 
program maintenance script
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
The \fBicmconf\fP configuration file is used to specify and tailor the
characteristics of program maintenance performed by the \fBicmbuild\fP(1) icmake
script\&. It can be used to activate and specify various directives that
determine how the program or library maintenance will proceed\&. 
.PP 
The directives are biased towards the construction of a \fBC++\fP program, but
program maintenance for other languages (e\&.g\&., \fBC\fP) can easily be realized
as well\&. 
.PP 
.SH "PROGRAM AND SOURCE CONFIGURATION"

.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define MAIN \(dq\&main\&.cc\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The specification of the file defining the \fIint main\fP function\&. This
specification may be left as\-is if \fBicmbuild\fP(1) is used for library
maintenance rather than program maintenance\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define BINARY \(dq\&binary\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the binary program\&. Can be left as\-is if the intent is to
construct a library rather than a program\&. Don\(cq\&t specify a path
here\&. The installation path can be specified at the \fIBIN_INSTALL\fP
directive (see below)
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define REFRESH\fP
.br 
By defining \fIREFRESH\fP the binary program is always relinked, even
when no sources were modified\&. This can be useful if, e\&.g\&., a separate
library was rebuilt against which the program must be linked\&. By
default \fIREFRESH\fP is \fInot\fP defined\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define BIN_INSTALL         \(dq\&/usr/local/bin\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive specifies the location where \fIicmbuild install\fP will
install the binary program\&.

.PP 
.SH "LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION"

.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define LIBRARY           \(dq\&modules\(dq\&\fP
.br 
By default this directive is not defined\&. If defined a local library is
defined\&. When a binary program is built it will be linked against the
library rather than the individual object modules\&. If library
construction is required (see below at the \fIDEFCOM\fP directive), then
the \fILIBRARY\fP directive defines the name of the library that is
built\&. Change the library\(cq\&s name at your own digression\&. Don\(cq\&t use
\fIlib\fP or an extension like \fI\&.a\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SHARED\fP
.br 
This directive is only interpreted if \fILIBRARY\fP was also specified\&.
If \fISHARED\fP is defined a static library (extension \fI\&.a\fP) as well
as a shared library (extension \fI\&.so\fP) is built\&. If not specified
only the static library is built\&. By default \fISHARED\fP is not
defined\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SHAREDREQ           \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
When creating a shared library:
Specify the names of any libraries and library paths that are required
by the shared library between the double quotes\&. E\&.g\&., if a library is
found in \fI/usr/lib/special\fP use \fI\(dq\&\-L/usr/lib/special \-lspecial\(dq\&\fP
assuming that the name of the required library is \fIlibspecial\&.so\fP\&.
The \fI/lib\fP and \fI/usr/lib\fP paths are usually predefined and need
not be specified\&. This directive is only interpreted if \fISHARED\fP and
\fILIBRARY\fP were also defined\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define LIB_INSTALL         \(dq\&/usr/local/lib\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive specifies the location where \fIicmbuild install\fP will
install the library (libraries)\&. By default it is not specified\&. It
should only be specified if \fILIBRARY\fP was also specified\&.

.PP 
.SH "COMPILING AND LINKING"

.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define CLS\fP
.br 
The \fIclear screen\fP directive\&. If defined \fItput clear\fP is called to
clear the terminal screen before starting the compilation\&. By default
it is not defined\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define USE_ALL     \(dq\&ALL\(dq\&\fP
.br 
When this directive is specified (by default it is \fInot\fP specified) a
class dependency setup defined in the CLASSES file will be used\&. In
this case, when a directory contains a file named at the \fIUSE_ALL\fP
directive (the default \fIicmconf\fP file pre\-specifies the filename
\fIALL\fP) then all sources of that class as well as all sources of all
classes depending on it are (re)compiled\&.
.IP 
Class dependencies in CLASSES consist of the class name (as the first
word on a line) optionally followed by additional class names, which
are the classes directly depending on the line\(cq\&s first class name\&.
.IP 
Assuming that a program uses five classes \fIOne, Two, Three, Four\fP and
\fIfive\fP and that class \fIThree\fP depends on class \fITwo\fP, which in
turn depends on class \fIOne\fP, while class \fIFive\fP depends on
\fIFour\fP and \fITwo\fP, then the file \fICLASSES\fP may reflect these
dependencies: 
.nf 

    one
    two     one
    three   two
    four
    five    two four
            
.fi 
Creating the file \fIthree/ALL\fP (using e\&.g\&., \fItouch three/ALL\fP) will
cause all sources of the classes \fIThree, Two\fP and \fIOne\fP to be
recompiled\&. Creating \fI\fIfive/ALL\fP\fP will cause all sources of
classes \fIFive, Four, Two\fP and \fIOne\fP to be recompiled\&.
.IP 
This facility was added to the \fIicmbuild\fP script because \fBC++\fP
header files are often modified \fIwithout\fP the need to recompile all
their depending sources\&. No recompilation is necessary when a new
class member is declared\&. Recompilation \fIis\fP necessary when the
class\(cq\&s internal organization changes, e\&.g\&., when the organization of
its data members is modified\&. By simply creating a file \fIALL\fP the
required recompilations will be performed\&.
.IP 
Following the recompilation the \fIALL\fP \fBs\fP are removed\&.  
.IP 
Note also that when the \fIUSE_ALL\fP directive is used the command
\fIicmbuild clean\fP also removes any leftover \fIUSE_ALL\fP files from
the program\(cq\&s direct subdirectories\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define COMPILER            \(dq\&g++\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive defines the compiler to use\&. The default is shown\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define COMPILER_OPTIONS    \(dq\&\-\-std=c++0x \-g \-Wall \-O2\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive defines the compiler options to use\&. The default flags
are shown\&. To enable GNU extensions in addition to the compiler\(cq\&s
C++0x extensions, add the \fI\-\-std=gnu++0x\fP flag\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SOURCES             \(dq\&*\&.cc\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive defines the pattern to locate sources in a
directory\&. Its default value is shown\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define LINKER_OPTIONS      \(dq\&\-s\(dq\&\fP
.br 
This directive defines the options the compiler should pass to the
linker\&. Its default value is shown\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define ADD_LIBRARIES       \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
When a program (see \fIBINARY\fP above) must be linked against additional
libraries (other than the name of the program\(cq\&s library itself, if
specified at \fILIBRARY\fP) then those libraries should be specified,
blank space separated, here\&. E\&.g\&., when a program is linked against
\fIlibbobcat\fP then the specification is:
.nf 

    #define ADD_LIBRARIES   \(dq\&bobcat\(dq\&
    
.fi 

.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define ADD_LIBRARY_PATHS  \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
When the additional libraries (specified at \fIADD_LIBRARIES\fP) are
located in non\-standard library locations (e\&.g\&., not in \fI/lib\fP and
\fI/usr/lib\fP) then these additional paths are (blank space separated) 
specified here\&. Only the paths should be specified, not the \fI\-L\fP
flags\&. 

.PP 
.SH "LEXICAL SCANNERS"

.PP 
When a program uses a lexical scanner, generated by a scanner generator like
\fBflex\fP(1), the \fIicmbuild\fP script can be used to update the scanner source
whenever the scanner specification file is modified\&. Here are the directives
that are related to the use of a lexical scanner generator:
.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANNER_DIR         \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
If a lexical scanner must be constructed, then  the subdirectory 
containing the scanner\(cq\&s specification file is specified with this
directive\&. If empty (the default) no scanner construction is monitored
by \fIicmbuild\fP and all remaining scanner\-related directives are
ignored\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANGEN             \(dq\&flex\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the program generating the lexical scanner\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANFLAGS           \(dq\&\-I\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The flags to use when calling the program specified at \fISCANGEN\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANSPEC            \(dq\&lexer\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the lexical scanner specification file\&. This file is
expected in the directory specified at \fISCANNER_DIR\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANFILES            \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
If the lexical scanner specification file named at \fISCANSPEC\fP itself
includes additional specification files, then patterns matching these
additional lexer specification files should be specified here\&. The
pattern is interpreted in the directory specified at \fISCANNER_DIR\fP
and could contain a subdirectory name (e\&.g\&. \fIspecs/*\fP)\&. When files
matching the pattern are modified then a new lexical scanner will be
created\&. By default no additional specification files are used\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define SCANOUT             \(dq\&yylex\&.cc\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the file generated by the lexical scanner (which is used by
\fIicmbuild\fP to compare the timestamps of the scanner specification
\fBs\fP against)\&.

.PP 
.SH "GRAMMAR PARSERS"

.PP 
When a program uses a grammar parser, generated by a parser generator like
\fBbisonc++\fP(1), the \fIicmbuild\fP script can be used to update the parser\(cq\&s
sources whenever a parser specification file is modified\&. Here are the
directives that are related to the use of a parser generator:
.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSER_DIR          \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
If a parser must be constructed, then  the subdirectory 
containing the parser\(cq\&s specification file is specified with this
directive\&. If empty (the default) no parser construction is monitored
by \fIicmbuild\fP and all remaining parser\-related directives are
ignored\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSGEN             \(dq\&bisonc++\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the program generating the parser\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSFLAGS           \(dq\&\-V \-l\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The flags to use when calling the program specified at \fIPARSGEN\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSSPEC            \(dq\&grammar\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the parser specification file\&. This file is
expected in the directory specified at \fIPARSER_DIR\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSFILES           \(dq\&\(dq\&\fP
.br 
If the parser specification file named at \fIPARSSPEC\fP itself includes
additional specification files, then patterns matching these
additional grammar specification files should be specified here\&. The
pattern is interpreted in the directory specified at \fIPARSER_DIR\fP
and could contain a subdirectory name (e\&.g\&. \fIspecs/*\fP)\&. When files
matching the pattern are modified then a new parser will be
created\&. By default no additional specification files are used\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define PARSOUT \(dq\&parse\&.cc\(dq\&\fP
.br 
The name of the file generated by the parser generator (which is used
by \fIicmbuild\fP to compare the timestamps of the parser specification
\fBs\fP against)\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define GRAMBUILD\fP
.br 
Since \fIbisonc++\fP version 2\&.0\&.0 this directive is obsolete, but is
kept for backward compatibility\&. It is removed from the \fIicmconf\fP
skeleton file\&. The \fIPARSEFILES\fP directive overrules the use of
\fIGRAMBUILD\fP\&.

.PP 
.SH "ADDITIONAL DIRECTIVES"

.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define USE_VERSION\fP
.br 
When this directive is specified (which is the default) 
the file \fIVERSION\fP will be read by \fIicmconf\fP to determine the
version of the program, the program release years and the program\(cq\&s
author name\&. The default \fIVERSION\fP file generated by \fIicmstart\fP
defines \fIAUTHOR, VERSION\fP and \fIYEARS\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define DEFCOM  \(dq\&\&.\&.\&.\(dq\&\fP
.br 
A \fIDEFCOM\fP directive may be added to the \fIicmconf\fP file by
\fIicmstart\fP\&. If added, it may be defined as
.nf 

    #define DEFCOM  \(dq\&program\(dq\&
        
.fi 
in which case \fIicmbuild\fP will do program maintenance\&. It may also be
defined as as 
.nf 

    #define DEFCOM  \(dq\&library\(dq\&
       
.fi 
in which case \fIicmbuild\fP will de library maintenance\&. 
.IP 
If this directive was not added by \fIicmstart\fP it can always be added
to \fIicmconf\fP by hand\&.

.PP 
The following directives usually require no tweaking:
.PP 
.IP o 
\fB#define USE_ECHO              ON\fP
.br 
When specified as \fION\fP (rather than \fIOFF\fP) commands executed by
\fIicmbuild\fP are echoed\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB#define TMP_DIR             \(dq\&tmp\(dq\&\fP
