.SH "NAME"
icmstart\&.rc \- The icmstart(1) resource file
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
The \fBicmstart\&.rc\fP file defines the initial files of a program that are
installed by \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&. 
.PP 
By default \fBicmstart\&.rc\fP is found in \fI/etc/icmake/icmstart\&.rc\fP, but if a
file \fI$HOME/\&.icmake/icmstart\&.rc\fP is found then the latter file is used by
\fBicmstart\fP(1)\&. \fI$HOME/\&.icmake/icmstart\&.rc\fP in turn is overruled by
specifying a \fI\-c\fP option when invoking \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.PP 
The default resource file contains the following specifications, preparing for
the construction of a \fBC++\fP program using \fBicmbuild\fP(1):
.nf 

    CLASSES
    main\&.cc     
    main\&.ih     
    usage\&.cc
    version\&.cc
    ? scanner
    ? parser
        
.fi 
The \fIicmstart\&.rc\fP file may contain:
.IP o 
empty lines are ignored;
.IP o 
lines beginning with the hash\-character (\fI#\fP) are ignored;
.IP o 
Source path names\&. Relative path names are interpreted relative to
the current working directory\&. Environment variables are not expanded, the
initial tilde character is interpreset as the user\(cq\&s home directory\&.
.IP o 
Source path names followed by a destination (relative to the
directory initialized by \fBicmstart\fP(1))\&.
A source path may be either a file or a directory\&. If a directory is
specified then all files in and below that directory will be installed\&.
.PP 
When specifying a destination a path may be specified as well\&. However, the
destination path is always interpreted relative to the installation directory
specified when calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.PP 
If a destination is omitted, the source is installed as specified below
\fBicmstart\fP(1)\(cq\&s destination directory\&.
.PP 
The first character of a line may be a question mark (followed by white
space, a source path and optionally a destination path\&. In this case the user
is 
asked to confirm that the source path should indeed be installed\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP 
The following entries can be used in an \fIicmstart\&.rc\fP file:
.IP o 
\fIsource\fP
.br 
`Source\(cq\& must be in the skeleton directory visited by \fBicmstart(1)\fP
and is installed as \fIsource\fP in the destination directory specified when
calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.IP o 
\fIsource dest\fP
.br 
`Source\(cq\& must be in the skeleton directory visited by \fBicmstart(1)\fP
and is installed as \fIdest\fP in the destination directory specified when
calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.IP o 
\fI~/path\fP
.br 
`~/path\(cq\& is installed as \fI~/path\fP in the destination directory
specified when calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&. The \fI~\fP\-character is expanded to the
user\(cq\&s home directory\&.
.IP o 
\fI~/path dest\fP
.br 
`~/path\(cq\& is installed as \fIdest\fP in the destination directory
specified when calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&. The \fI~\fP\-characteris expanded to the
user\(cq\&s home directory\&.
.IP o 
\fI/path\fP
.br 
`/path\(cq\& is installed as \fI\&./path\fP in the destination directory
specified when calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.IP o 
\fI/path dest\fP
.br 
`/path\(cq\& is installed as \fIdest\fP in the destination directory
.IP o 
\fI? source\fP
.br 
The user must confirm the installation of \fIsource\fP\&.
.IP o 
\fI? source dest\fP
.br 
The user must confirm the installation of \fIsource\fP as \fIdest\fP in
the destination directory specified when calling \fBicmstart\fP(1)\&.
.IP o 
\fI# text\fP
.br 
Interpreted as comment and ignored\&. The \fI#\fP\-character must be the
first character on the line\&.
.IP o 
an empty line
.br 
Empty lines are skipped\&.

.SH "FILES"
