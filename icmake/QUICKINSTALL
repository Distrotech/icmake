0. After unpacking the icmake_X.YY.tar.gzicmake archive, make your current
   working directory equal to the directory in which you found this file.

1. Inspect the intended locations in ./def/destinations. In particular check:

        #define BINDIR      "/usr/bin"
        #define SKELDIR     "/usr/share/icmake"
        #define MANDIR      "/usr/share/man/man1"
        #define LIBDIR      "/usr/lib/icmake"
        
        #define EXTENSION   "" 
            For CYGWIN use: #define EXTENSION   ".exe"


2. Create the icmake related files in tmp/$BINDIR, tmp/$SKELDIR tmp/$MANDIR
    and tmp/$LIBDIR
                    sh bootstrap.sh

3. As root do:
                    sh install.sh [strip]

4. Garbage removal:

                    rm -rf tmp
