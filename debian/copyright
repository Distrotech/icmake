Some Legal Stuff
----------------

        You don't have to pay us for Icmake. This means that no fee is
charged for it by us.  As with everything that's free, there's no pay but
also *absolutely no warranty*.  Furthermore, you are allowed (and
encouraged) to distribute Icmake, provided that you include this information
with each distribution.  It is strongly suggested that you do *not* charge
money for the distribution of Icmake (possibly not even the $5 for
shipping).

        The source files and the documentation for Icmake are copyrighted by
us.  The reason for this is (a) that we'd like to have always the last
version of Icmake, and (b) that we'd like to have the last word in all
modifications.  If you have requests (or even better, "working code" to
include in Icmake) please mail us and we'll gladly oblige when we find the
time.

The author also told me:

but in our website www.icce.rug.nl/docs/software.html, we explicitly state
that ALL software that we make publicly available is distributed according to
the GPL, whatever the docs (still) tell you. So don't worry. It's ony a bit
inconvenient that the copyright-information that is distributed with (some) of
our software is still a bit incongruent with the GPL. But again: ignore that,
and consider all our software free.

If you have a patch and want it to be part of icmake of whatever software we
distribute, go ahead!

Which doesn't mean that we're not interested in receiving information about
that patch :-)

But I guess that goes without saying.


You can find a copy of the GPL in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
